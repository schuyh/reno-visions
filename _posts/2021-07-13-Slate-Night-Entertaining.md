This off-the-kitchen extension is an ideal space for hosting a late night dinner party, indoors and out. The grand fireplace is a warm, inviting place to relax -- when you're not outside enjoying the firepit, that is. 

The brickwork was the basis for a slate and concrete colour palette with cast iron accents. The look is lightened by blonde hardwood floors and white trim.
